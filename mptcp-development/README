We have developed a model for MultiPath-TCP (MPTCP) in ns-3, which conform to RFC 6824 and closely follows the MPTCP Linux kernel desgin. 

A brief description of our model can be found in our recent short paper, which was presented at the WNS3-2014 workshop, with the following link: http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07721

You can refer to this code in your paper by citing the above short paper.
